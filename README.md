**BlooPy** is a fast discrete optimization package because it translates the optimization to a bitstring encoding, and uses efficient bitstring procedures implemented in C. 

In addition to fitness functions of type "bitarray() --> float", **BlooPy** is also usable with fitness functions on discrete vectors "list[] --> float" or fitness dictionaries. The ```utils.discrete_space``` translates fitness dict or vector-based function to bitstring encoding for the use. See examples/example_discrete_space.py.

**BlooPy** allows users to assemble components for population-based algorithms by passing components such as mutation functions, reproduction functions to the algorithm at initialization: 

```python
fitness_functions # Input: bitstring of bitarray() type, Output: fitness (float)
mutation_functions # Input: list of individuals, Output: None
reproductive functions # Input: list of individuals (parents), Output: list of individuals (children)
selection_functions # Input: {list(individuals), list(individuals), float}. The float is -1 or 1 depending on whether we are minimizing or maximizing
```

Additional components can easily be added by the user as long as the function has the same signature as specified.

## Examples

To learn more about the functionality of the package check out our
examples folder. As a test suite, we have included code to generate adjacent, and randomized MK functions [[2]](#2). The examples folder contains scripts to test each algorithm on randomized MK functions.

<summary><b>Simple local search on bitstring problem</b></summary>

```python
import numpy as np
from bitarray.util import ba2int
import algorithms.local_search as mls

# Define fitness function and searchspace
N = 20 # size of bitstring

fitness_values = np.arange(1, 1 + 2**N)
np.random.shuffle(fitness_values)
fitness_func = lambda bs: fitness_values[ba2int(bs)]
print("Size of search space:", len(fitness_values))

# Configure Local Search algorithm (RandomGreedy MLS in this case)
iterations = 10000 # Max number of random restarts
minmax = -1 # -1 for minimization problem, +1 for maximization problem
maxfeval = 100000 # Number of unique fitness queries MLS is allowed

test_mls = mls.RandomGreedyMLS(fitness_func,
        N,
        minmax)

best_fit, _, fevals = test_mls.solve(iterations,
            max_time=10,#seconds
            stopping_fitness=1,#1 is optimal value so we can stop
            max_funcevals=maxfeval,
            verbose=True)
print("Best fitness found:", best_fit, "in", fevals, "evaluations | optimal fitness:", 1)

<summary><b>GA on bitstring randomized MK function</b></summary>

Let's run a genetic algorithm (see examples/example_ga.py). Firstly, import the modules and set the seed for reproducibility:

```python
import random
import fitness_functions as ff
import dynamic_programming as dp
import genetic_algorithm as ga
import mutation_functions as mut
import reproductive_functions as rep
import selection_functions as sel

random.seed(1234567)
```

Generate an adjacent or randomized MK function for testing. For this type of fitness function we have supplied a solver which uses dynamic programming.

```python
## Generate a (randomized) MK fitness function
k = 4;
m = 33*(k-1);
randomMK = True
if randomMK:
    mk_func = ff.random_MK_function(m, k)
    mk_func.generate()
else:
    mk_func = ff.adjacent_MK_function(m, k)
    mk_func.generate()

## Find optimal solution using dynamic programming for comparison
best_dp_fit = dp.dp_solve_MK(mk_func)
print("Max fitness DP:", best_dp_fit)
```

**BlooPy** allows users to assemble the components of an evolutionary algorithm separately, which can then be passed as functions at initialization:

```python
fitness_func = adj_mk_func.get_fitness
population_size = 500
reproductor = rep.twopoint_crossover
selector = sel.tournament2_selection
bitstring_size = m
test_ga = ga.genetic_algorithm(fitness_func,
            reproductor,
            selector,
            population_size,
            bitstring_size,
            min_max_problem=1, # This is a maximzation problem
            input_pop=None)
```

Run the GA to solve the problem and choose termination conditions:

```python
x = test_ga.solve(min_variance=0.1,
            max_iter=1000,
            no_improve=300,
            max_time=15,#seconds
            stopping_fitness=0.98*best_dp_fit,#fraction of optimum we want (optional)
            max_funcevals=200000)
print("Best fitness:",x[0],", fraction of optimal {0:.4f}".format(x[0]/float(best_dp_fit)))
```

<summary><b>Local search on categorical optimization problem</b></summary>

Let's run a GreedyMLS algorithm on an example discrete categorical optimization problem. For this, we will use the ```utils.discrete_space``` class to map the categorical vectors to bitstring encoding automatically. Firstly, lets define a class that takes some categorical search space and gives each possibility a random fitness.


```python
import numpy as np
import itertools as it

import algorithms.local_search as mls
import utils

class categorical_fitness:
    def __init__(self, sspace):
        self.sspace = sspace
        self.ssvalues = list(self.sspace.values())#Shorthand

        ### Give all possible (x1,x2,x3,x4) a random fitness value
        var_names = sorted(self.sspace)
        self.possible_xs = list(it.product(*(sspace[key] for key in var_names)))
        print("Size of search space:", len(self.possible_xs))

        # Define fitness function
        self.fitness_values = np.arange(1, 1 + len(self.possible_xs))
        np.random.shuffle(self.fitness_values)

        # Calculate bitstring size
        self.bsize = utils.calculate_bitstring_length(self.sspace)
        print("Size of bitstring:", self.bsize)

    def map_listvariable_to_index(self, vec):
        r"""For discrete categorical problems, bitstrings are implemented
          as segments where one bit is active in each segment, and this bit
          designates the parameter value for that variable."""
        # This function looks complicated, but it merely uniquely maps each
	#  possible vector to an index to get a random fitness value.
        indices = []
        it = 0
        for j, var in enumerate(vec):
            vals = self.ssvalues[j]
            for k, x in enumerate(vals):
                if x == var:
                    indices.append(k+it)
                    break
        multip = len(self.possible_xs)
        index = 0
        for i, key in enumerate(self.sspace.keys()):
            add = indices[i]
            multip /= len(self.sspace[key])
            add *= multip
            index += add
        return int(index)

    def fitness(self, vec):
        # Map each entry to a unique index, which points to a random fitness value
        return self.fitness_values[self.map_listvariable_to_index(vec)]
```

Next, define the categorial search space and use **BlooPy**'s converter ```utils.discrete_space```.

```python
### Construct some categorical discrete space
searchspace = {"x1": [1,2,3,4,5,6],
               "x2": ["foo", "bar"],
               "x3": [16, 32, 64, 128],
               "x4": ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]}

categorical_fit = categorical_fitness(searchspace)

# Create discrete space class
disc_space = utils.discrete_space(categorical_fit.fitness, searchspace)
```

Lastly, configure the Greedy local search algorithm and solve the problem.

```python
### Configure Local Search algorithm (RandomGreedy MLS in this case)
iterations = 10000 # Max number of random restarts
minmax = -1 # -1 for minimization problem, +1 for maximization problem
if minmax == 1:
    optfit = len(categorical_fit.possible_xs)
elif minmax == -1:
    optfit = 1
maxfeval = 100000 # Number of unique fitness queries MLS is allowed

test_mls = mls.RandomGreedyMLS(disc_space.fitness,
        categorical_fit.bsize,
        minmax,
        searchspace=searchspace)

best_fit, _, fevals = test_mls.solve(iterations,
            max_time=10,#seconds
            stopping_fitness=optfit,#1 is optimal value so we can stop
            max_funcevals=maxfeval,
            verbose=True)
print("Best fitness found:", best_fit, "in", fevals, "evaluations | optimal fitness:", optfit)
```

<summary><b>Continuous dual annealing algorithm on categorical optimization problem</b></summary>

To show case how continuous-based algorithms can be used, let's run Dual Annealing on the example categorical space from the last example. Firstly, lets import the class we used in the discrete example and define the discrete space.

```python
import numpy as np
import itertools as it

from simple_discrete_example import categorical_fitness
import algorithms.dual_annealing as dsa
import utils

### Construct some categorical discrete space
searchspace = {"x1": [1,2,3,4,5,6],
               "x2": ["foo", "bar"],
               "x3": [16, 32, 64, 128],
               "x4": ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]}

# Continuous algorithms require a search space to operate
categorical_fit = categorical_fitness(searchspace)
disc_space = utils.discrete_space(categorical_fit.fitness, searchspace)
```

Next, we simple configure the dual annealing algorithm and run it. The encoding for continuous real-valued solutions is automatically handled in the background by the ```individual.continuous_individual``` class in **BlooPy**.

```python
## Run dual annealing
# supported_methods = ['COBYLA','L-BFGS-B','SLSQP','CG','Powell','Nelder-Mead', 'BFGS', 'trust-constr']
method = "trust-constr"
iterations = 10000
minmax = -1 # -1 for minimization problem, +1 for maximization problem
if minmax == 1:
    optfit = len(categorical_fit.possible_xs)
elif minmax == -1:
    optfit = 1
maxfeval = 100000 # Number of unique fitness queries MLS is allowed

test_dsa = dsa.dual_annealing(disc_space.fitness,
        minmax,
        searchspace,
        method=method)

best_fit, _, fevals = test_dsa.solve(max_iter=iterations,
            max_time=10,#seconds
            stopping_fitness=optfit,
            max_funcevals=maxfeval)
print("Best fitness found:", best_fit, "in", fevals, "evaluations | optimal fitness:", optfit)
```

## Background on encoding solutions

<details>
<summary><b>Background information on how BlooPy operates on bitarrays</b></summary>
Some background information on how **BlooPy** operates: the algorithms are intended for discrete optimization problems, and they work on bitstrings. In principle, the user never has to interact with these bitstring directly. The algorithms create solutions in the shape of ```individual``` or ```continuous_individual``` classes. These handle most of the encoding. Furthermore, there are a number of helper classes and converter functions in ```utils.py``` (see Examples) meaning the user can call these to make their fitness functions or dictionaries usabl. **BlooPy** implements two types of bitstring. 

- Normal bitstrings which can take on any permutation. In this case, **BlooPy** creates ```individual(..., boundary_list=None)``` objects.
- Bounded bitstrings where only a single 1 can be present in each segment. The segments are defined by supplying a list of start- and endpoints of the segments: ```individual(..., boundary_list=[(0,4),(5,7),(8,12),..])```.

The first kind of bitstring is for bitstring based optimization problems. The second is used to encode finite discrete optimization problems. The bitstring is divided into segments with length equal to the number of parameter possibilities per variable. The i-th parameter value is selected by the bit that is turned on. So for variables ```x_i``` that take ```N_i``` values each, the lenght of the bitstring is ```N_1+N_2+...```. Note that the size of the searchspace is ```N_1*N_2*...``` so this is a relatively small encoding.

Bounded bitstrings are used when the optimization tasks is to find the optimal setttings when parameters which can each be selected from a finite list (can be numerical or categorical), e.g.:

```python
"""Suppose that possible choices of a problem are to select (x,y) 
from [16,32,64] and ['foo','bar']. In that case the bounded 
bitstring has length 5. The first segment consists of positions 
[0,1,2] and the second of [3,4].
"""
import individual as indiv

candidate = indiv.individual(5, boundary_list=[(0,2),(3,4)])
```

**Real-valued algorithms:** Instead of a discrete solution, **BlooPy** also supports continuous individuals which automatically take care of the conversion between the discrete optimization problem, and the continuous solver. This is done by mapping each variable uniformly onto [0,1]. This means that for each dimension, the interval [0,1] is divided into equal segments, and real-valued solutions snap to the nearest segment. This translates a real-valued solution to a discrete vector. Next, the usual encoding is used by **BlooPy** in the background to convert to bitstrings.
